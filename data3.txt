Subject: Application for filing an FIR against an unknown person for abuse and assault

Respected Sir/Madam,

I, Stuti Kumar, aged 20, female, residing at football chawk, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, contact number 02314543245, do hereby submit this application for filing an FIR against an unknown person for abuse and assault.

On 2023-09-14 at 16:12, I was in room no. 606 when an unknown person entered the room and started abusing me verbally. He then slapped me in front of everyone. I sustained bleeding gums as a result of the slap. I am also suffering from mental disturbance due to this incident.

I have two witnesses to the incident, namely Kartikey and Mayur. I also have CCTV footage of the incident as evidence.

I request you to kindly file an FIR against the unknown person and take necessary action against him.

Thank you,
Stuti Kumar
